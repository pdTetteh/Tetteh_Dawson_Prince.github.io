I'm a research assistant at the Responsible Artificial Intelligence Lab, KNUST.

I'm currently building an AI-powered assistive device for the visually impaired using YOLO and Faster R-CNN for object recognition OCR for real-time text-to-speech functionality.

I'm also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning.
